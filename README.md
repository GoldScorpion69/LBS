## Introduction

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

Hello, my name is Cacophony and I got into modding as a pimply teenager simply because I wanted to see naked women. For a long time that was my only goal. Then I discovered the communities surrounding Skyrim. From there I branched out, building the TUCOGUIDE, Lexy, morphing Lexy into LOTD Plus, and finally discovering Wabbajack and spending almost all of my time either starting a new list or changing one I or someone else had made. When I tried to integrate Lover's Lab content to combine my two modding passions, I found out through much pain and torture that usually porn doesn't work well with playing Skyrim and playing Skyrim doesn't mesh well with playing porn and I lacked the skill to change that. So I solved it by simply paring back my ambitions. As a novice modder I tried to do too much with my builds: combine full survival-style Skyrim with a ton of realistic sexuality simulations, or pile in Lover's Lab frameworks to make my experience as _muh immersion_ sexy as possible. None of these ever worked for me, so instead I offer you a more humble list intended for maximum stability and ease of play.

If you want the gist of what this horribly cribbed modlist is, it grew out of the two most common questions I heard in the Lexy Discord's NSFW channel: how do I add SexLab to this? And: how do I switch the body to CBBE? I quickly came to realize that you don't do either of these things... unless you want a broken list that would have been more easily built from the ground up. So I did just that, keeping the parts of Lexy that I liked (which was the vast majority of it), throwing in a few other things to the mix, and adding some options to sex things up for both male and female characters. While not intended as a replacement for a full-featured list like Lotus or a screenshot-posing oriented list like Cupid, Light But Sexy serves perfectly as a small, resource-friendly modlist requiring few updates that will provide an option for simple sexy play when other modlists are unavailable. Without further ado I present to you Light But Sexy: To Tide You Over.

## Requirements

It's recommended that you sign up for a Premium account on Nexus for five bucks a month (http://nexusmods.com)

Otherwise you'll have to download every file manually and put it in the right folder.

Also you'll need a Lover's Lab account (http://loverslab.com)

### System Specs

A note here. I use a 1080p monitor and I suspect the vast majority looking to play Skyrim in this day and age do too. So this modlist is geared toward two things: low VRAM usage and quick load times. Running the Skyrim Performance Monitor shows me that LBS only uses at most 6 GB of RAM and 6 GB of VRAM. You shouldn't need more than a midrange CPU and GPU from the last 5 years along with 8 GB VRAM and maybe 16 GB RAM (might could get away with 8). Strongly recommended is a solid state drive with at least 100 GB for the game itself and 50GB for the downloads (unless you never plan to update). This is not because load times are terrible on an HDD. Hashing with WJ for updates is a pain though.

### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time.

##### Change some Steam stuff

Right-click on Skyrim SE in your Steam library, choose Properties, uncheck _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_. While you're there, click the Updates tab and change it to _Only update this game when I launch it_. We will basically never launch Skyrim normally, it will always be via the script extender, so your game will never update. Finally, Wabbajack only supports the English version of Skyrim. If it's set to something else, go to the Language tab and switch it to English.

##### Clean Skyrim

If you have done _any_ modding of your Skyrim before, I recommend uninstalling it, deleting the Skyrim SE folder in Documents, then reinstalling it and taking the following steps:

1) Launch it from Steam
2) If it doesn't detect as Ultra, select Ultra
3) Set the _Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your preferred choices
4) Turn off _Antialiasing_
5) Uncheck _Windowed_ and _Borderless_

Then start the game and exit when you see the main menu (New Game, etc)

### Using Wabbajack

First get the latest version of LSM from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19cui-oVdXXTHIhcl8n6wfeq9D0CJQMKR.

Download it to wherever you keep your downloads.

LSM is now fully compatible with Wabbajack 2.0, the latest version. Get it from http://wabbajack.org

When you launch it, select to install _From Disk_ and point to the .wabbajack file you downloaded above.

Then follow the rest of Wabbajack's instructions.

##### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1) Open Wabbajack
2) Load the Modlist from Disk
3) Adjust the download and installation paths
4) Click the Go/Begin button
5) Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##### Problems with Wabbajack

If you have a problem, exit Wabbajack, give it the old off and then on again, and try running it again. Only then should you ask for help.

**Could not download x**:

If a file could not download or is not whitelisted, the modlist needs to be updated. You're going to have to wait on me. :(

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

You paid for Skyrim didn't you? If not, go buy it off Steam and try again.

#### Game Folder Files

Download the latest ENB Series from http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm and copy `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` to your Skyrim Special Edition folder inside your steamapps/common folder.

Finally, copy all of the files from the _game folder files_ directory inside the LSM installation directory to your Skyrim SE directory.

## A note on BodySlide

My closest friend and I created a meticulously crafted default BodySlide preset. The "1 weight" or overweight variation is a voluptuous, nipply interpretation of the CBBE 3BBB default body. The "0 weight" or underweight variation is a play on the CBBE Petite theme. This allows for variation among NPCs similar to what the designers intended. In short, lightweight NPCs will be petite and heavyweight NPCs will be thicc, with all sorts of variations in between. The morph files included for this preset with all the armor variations comprise the majority of the huge Wabbajack file. At least examine the body in RaceMenu and see if you like it before you toss it. If not, no worries! You can rebuild the bodies and armors to your liking. Be sure to tick everything in the groups menu except the CBBE variations. Make sure you get unassigned, as well.

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## A Few More Specific Notes

I'm not going to get deep into the weeds on all the mods included because quite frankly there's not anywhere near the amount of detail in this list as a lot of them and I don't think most of the people seeking to try this have a desire to read much about it. But here I will note a few things. My primary goal in creating this list was to play a super expanded LOTD with almost all of the huge worldspace mods like Falskaar, Wyrmstooth, Vigilant, etc included. I also wanted plenty of weapons and items to find organically without adding a bunch of collectibles that don't appeal to me. Now that one of our very own Wabbajack regulars has converted the massive _Book of UUNP_ to the CBBE 3BBB bodytype, this modlist includes hundreds of female armor variations in different stages of lewdness. Most of the visuals, character development and gameplay mechanics are either cribbed from Lexy or strongly resemble Lexy with the exception of TUDM The Ultimate Dodge Mod. I guess that's all I have to say about that.

I did NOT include creature support because I wanted to use the Nemesis Behavior Engine without having to shoehorn FNIS in there too. I also did not include Devious Devices or any of its soft dependencies like Cursed Loot because only someone with more modding experience than me would know how to get those to stay stable in the long term. Hell I've run a list with nothing but ZaZ, DD, and Cursed Loot on Oldrim (their native soil) and have my save crap itself with guards attacking me in an infinite bondage prison loop within 12 hours of starting a new game so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Be A Casanova, Not A Maquis De Sade

The primary and most visible SexLab mods you'll be able to see are Amorous Adventures and Amorous Adventures Extended. These add hilarious meme-worthy sexy quests to a lot of the biggest female NPCs in Skyrim (including poor Elisif) and not only that, original voice assets are mixed and matched to give complete voiceover support to the custom dialogs. Unfortunately these were mostly designed with male characters in mind so if you play a female you'll see one of the partners strappin' it on most of the time. To SexLab's horrible default strapon problem I've included a couple I customized with collisions myself. They're weird-looking but lore-friendly! The next biggest one is SLEN - SexLab Eager NPCs which allows for a customizable seduction system. To round out the mix is SexLab Solutions which adds a bunch of ways to complete quests by either sexing them up yourself or offering one of your followers in case you're not into the target in question.

### Defeat

Defeat is here but it's highly conditional, meaning you'll see it randomly instead of frequently and sometimes just because you got hit really hard without blocking. If you have any followers on your side they will have to get knocked down too before you get taken advantage of. If you want to see yourself getting taken advantage of more often, try traveling without a follower. To guarantee it, under _Player as Victim_ set yourself to _Essential_ but I recommend against this option because as I understand it magnifies all of Defeat's bugs about tenfold. I would definitely reload the game after every Defeat scenario if you do this. And anyway, if a bandit is going to take advantage of you and steal your stuff, do you really think s/he would leave you alive to tell somebody about it? Muh immersion. If you don't want to be taken advantage of at all and prefer a quick, merciful death, disable the _Player as Victim_ section completely. This will still allow you to sublimate your fantasies harmlessly into Skyrim by tying people up and putting them in bags for later. Speaking of which, if you feel the need to defeat someone outside of combat, you can either sneak up behind them and press G, or mark them with G and try to knock them down with your fists. If you do this in the presence of others you _will_ get attacked with my settings. I encourage you to experiment with Defeat to adjust it to your liking, but keep in mind it's a very buggy mod that's been rewritten many times.

### Camera

I included the vastly inferior IFPV because I've got it defaulting to off so it doesn't muck with gameplay. From first person mode, you have to hit Numpad 0, then F to switch it on. It doesn't work at all when the partners are really close together (too much clipping) but it at least gives you a quick default to setting up your own POV view with Numpad 3. Relax and enjoy on it. Honestly I use this more to take a quick look down at my own huge bouncy boobs. Another reason I have this is so _Alternate Conversation Camera_ can be used in conjunction (so long as IFPV is disabled) because I can't resist the chance to at least see my own carefully crafted character in gameplay-related closeups.

### General Skyrim Gameplay

Most of the actual non-sexual content of this modlist is cribbed, again, from Lexy so if you're at all familiar with that setup you'll be right at home here. I will mention that the "CLARALUX Research Facility" has been left in and I encourage you to go there and turn up the radius and brightness of the game's lanterns and torches... it's far more believable and playable that way than pretending everyone in Skyrim constantly stumbles around in pitch blackness during the night-time. It's just north of Riverwood and available via fast travel from the beginning of the game. One thing I did add was the Ultimate Dodge Mod for a script-free instantaneous dodge roll. One thing I left out was the tedium of Needs mods and the ridiculous punishing difficulty of trios of level 35 Draugr Overlords in the first dungeon screaming Fus Ro Dah at you every three seconds. I did make sure CACO and CCOR work for the fun of building lotsa stuff that's overpowered.

### Bodies and NPCs

For the bodies I used CBBE 3BBB. I've been hearing good things about SMP improvements in my other modding Discords so it might be possible to leave SMP on the player only for the majority of the game. If you get in a heavy combat scenario, though, and your belly stretches to infinity... well SMP has crashed and you'll have to exit the game to continue. I haven't encountered this myself, but in previous builds I would get around it by using SMP only during sexytime. You can also turn SMP on various NPC's with numpads 5-8 but it will reset their equipment to default. So do it before you start a scene or it'll get a lot more modest.  For NPCs, it's your traditional WICO, Pandorables, Bijin combo, only I added a few of Eeekie's (especially that crafty Cicero) on top. This may introduce the possibiility of BFBs (brown face bugs) so please tell me if you see any of those so I can patch them out. Finally, everyone wearing vanilla clothes or armor has been outfitted with much sexier gear. It's not as in-your-face as my previous build, just so I could have a little variety, but the list is still decidedly unwelcome among mixed company. Play it alone! If you want to hide your shame, or simply muh immersion at the idea of Mjoll walking around with all four cheeks on display, stop by NSFW and I'll tell you how to get everyone to cover up their meat. The armor from the worldspace mods like Falskaar has been left unchanged.

### Poser Mods

I submit to you that posing is better suited for a more full-featured adult modlist like erri120's _Lotus_ or a screenshot-focused one like Geez's _Cupid_, but if you must add one, Nemesis isn't up to the task of handling that many animations. I recommend you switch to FNIS. Disable _Nemesis Behavior Engine_, _The Ultimate Dodge Mod_, _The Ultimate Dodge Mod Reanimated_, and _Nemesis Output_. Install _FNIS_ and move it just below _SexLabFramework_ in the left pane. Activate it and move the ESP just below _SkyUI_SE.esp_ in the right pane. Install your poser mod. A link to FNIS is already left over, but when you run it be sure to tick _Gender-Specific Animations_ and _Ultimate Combat_. If you want a dodge of some kind you'll have to install _TK Dodge_ before you do this.

### Followers

The only thing that will conflict with Followers like _Lucien_, _Inigo_ and others is the _Nether Follower Framework_. You can craft an "NFF Ignore Token" at any forge that will cause them to circumvent Nether. I have never done this myself as I added a Nether patch for 3DNPC and that's all I was interested in, so you'll probably have to drop by the channel for help if you don't already know what to do. Of course if you use more than one follower at a time (even with Nether) the game will be way too easy at the settings I recommend so you'll have to up it in the relevant menus.

### Final Notes

The vanilla start _should_ work for those who care about that kinda thing or for those who are new to Skyrim. One of the advantages of a small(er) modlist and the prisoner cart fix. One caveat though is that you have to give time for all the starting scripts to complete before you start the scenario. I recommend after you choose the vanilla start from the Mara statue that you wait a full **60 Seconds** before sleeping in the bed that starts the game. No guarantees, though, especially if you've added something.

Finally, after 3DNPC and LOTD updated and I realized I'd have to pare through two dozen of my custom modgroups to resolve all my conficts, I decided to abandon The Method. Instead we have a Bash + Smash combo with a few hand edits for stuff I found intolerable. If this is greek to you don't worry about it. The only thing the enduser might notice is that its harder to remove stuff since the Smash Patch has so many masters.

## Game MCM Options

None of this is written in stone, these are just the settings I use. Play freely with great abandon on all the sexy stuff. Consider carefully any gameplay changes because with just a couple of them you can make things either really hard or really easy. I myself don't have the balance perfect, bandits and dragons crush me but I generally walk through everything else.

**Wait until no new messages appear in the top left corner!**

If you get no more messages, save the game and open the MCM.

## SexLab

Hit the install/update SexLab thingie on the right.

Close the MCM menu and wait for all the messages to stop.

Reopen the menu and:

Under _Sex Diary_ set your sexuality to your preference.

Under _Rebuild and Clean_ choose _Import Settings_

Close the MCM menu, save the game, wait 10 seconds, then reload.

## A Matter of Time

Easy peasy. Just head to the _Presets_ menu and choose _Load User Settings_

## Clockwork

Unless you want to go mad, change the _Gilded Recovery Time_ to _24 Hours_

## Complete Alchemy

I don't recommend changing a single thing here. If you're salty about the lack of needs mods, you can go to _Basic Needs_ and enable _Hunger_ and _Fatigue_. If you do this, set Notifications to _3rd Person_

## Complete Crafting

OK, this one's annoying.

Under _Recipe Display_, disable _Crafting Categories_ and _Item Type Filters_ because I haven't been able to get them right.

Under _Crafting Options_, I recommend enabling _Artifact Replicas_ so you can make some truly badass stuff and _Matching Set Circlets_ so your Bijins don't have to cover their fabulous hair with ugly helmets.

Under _Learning & XP_, set _Tanning Rack_ to 0.2 and _Smelter_ to 0.1.

Almost done. Under _Mining & Materials_, set the Mining Preset to _Faster Mining_ and _Firewood_ like so:

_Firewood Per Chop:_ 6

_Max Per Activation:_ 1

You'll be glad you did.

Finally, under _Miscellaneous_:

Set Leveled Items to _Auto Upgrade_. This way your unique gear will level with you!

## Deadly Dragons

Don't do anything here but turn off Knockdown unless you want dragons to make you ragequit.

## Extended UI

Hit _Hide Legendary_, _Show Attribute Modifiers_, and _Show Skill Modifiers_

## FEC

You can do a lot of wacky stuff with this one, like make people explode or melt. But to keep you from spending all day in here I just say go to _Player Effects_ and enable _Soul Absorb_ for when those dragons inevitably kill you.

## Follower Framework

Like _Matter of Time_, this one let me do all the work beforehand. Just go to _System_ and under _Save/Load Config_ hit _Load From File_.

Exit the MCM and reopen.

## GIST Soul Trap

Don't make soul traps reliant on your Enchanting skill. That's annoying. Just enable messages when you trap a soul and leave everything else alone.

## Immersive Creatures

This mod barely works so you'll have to disable most of it. Here goes...

First go to _Creature Toggles_ and disable _Goblins_. They cause crashes.

Then go to _Additional Spawns_, _Night Spawns_, and _Random Spawns_ and set them all to _Deactivated_. They all cause crashes.

Why is this mod in here you ask? Well... this is the 90s. A man's gotta have a little variety.

## LOTD Settings

Under _General_ set _Shipment Crate Locations_ to all available... _Carriages, Inns and Player Houses_

## Maids II: Deception

Shoutout to erri. I wanted to see what this was about before Lotus 0.3's release in 2077 so it's still in here. I read the world encounters have issues so disable them under _Settings_.

## OBIS: Patrols

Just _Enable?_ and move on.

## Quick Light

The brighter the better. Set _Brightness_ to _Wide_ and the hotkey to your preference, I like to have things on the Numpad so I always set it to Numpad 1.

## Sacrosant Vampires

_Disable Fortitude_ or Defeat will screw up your game as a vampire. If you're like me and think feeding should make you stronger instead of weaker, turn on _Vampiric Drain: Reverse Progression_

## SexLab Aroused

Under Settings, hit _Purge Dead Actors_ and _Enable SOS_

If it were me in the interest of preventing Papyrus strain I would I would max the _Scan Interval_ out to _300_ but thats very unresponsive so just leave it where it is.

## SexLab Eager NPCs

I can't really tell you how you like your porn, man. Do what you want. I recommend hitting _Enable and Set Defaults_ for a base to work from. Everything else is kinda up to you, but I will tell you that the _Leveled List_ section adds a bunch of sexytime potions scattered around for roleplay purposes, and don't worry about what _SOS Integration_ reports because that detection is broken. Otherwise the mod works, trust me! One final note, if you want seduction to be really easy like you're the hottest being alive, you can do that with the charm difficulty. Even still you'll have to pay up at the beginning. But don't worry, your Speech will also go up with every success (the amount of which is also configurable) and it'll get easier.

## SexLab Tools

I have had trouble starting scenes with this. This mod at times seems to put actors in the wrong slot and cause them to go invisible for some reason I can't explain. I'm considering replacing it with something else. For now it's only useful for changing animations with the H key during a scene.

## SkyUI

Only thing you need to change here is on the main page. Under _Active Effects HUD_, untick the _Enabled_ option. Those icons overlap my Matter of Time preset.

## SL Anim Loader

Just hit _Enable All_, wait for the message, then hit _Register Anims_ and wait for the message. Takes a bit.

## SLA Monitor Widget

Configure this how you like, but I recommend setting the _Interval_ to _120 or higher_ since that's when Aroused updates and the _Scanning Range_ to _512_ to keep it from scanning everything for miles around. You might further limit it to dudes if you only have interest in them or the ladies if you're oriented that way. But if you're open-minded or nosy then scan away! I will mention this, though, on the _Widget Looks_ section you might want to change _Vertical Anchor_ to _Bottom_ so the aroused indicators won't overlap the notifications area.

## Storm Lighting

Some of my users are reporting problems with too much lightning, so set the _Preset_ to _Ultra Realistic_ and under _Advanced_, be sure to hit _Compatibility Mode_. It's required for Cathedral Weathers.

## The Ultimate Dodge Mod

Ah, my favorite part of this mod list. Instant 8 way dodges. An **Important Note** here is that Step Dodge will _not work_ with the dodge roll animation I have installed. If you try it you will do a funky planking float in midair which is pretty funny to see but probably not why you play. Set it to  _Roll Only_ to avoid this. If you want the option to switch between roll and step like the dodge mod was designed, untick _Dodge Roll Reanimated_ in the modlist and rerun Nemesis. It's kinda tricky to use, Sneak has been moved to the Shift key and you roll dodge with Control. **None of this will work until you leave the starting cell and start the game proper.**

## Trade & Barter

Enable _Modify Barter Settings_ and set the preset to _Medium_

This keeps you from accumulating hundreds of thousands of gold unless you become a master wordsmith so if you don't like that turn it off.

## Ultimate Combat

Under _Game Balance_, disable _Speed Bonus_.

Under _Others_, disable _Swing Effect_. This has been known to bug out with Nemesis and render you incapable of weapon animations.

Under _NPC Setting_, set _Dodge_ to _Disable_. This is handled by TUDM.

## Wildcat

Only thing you have to change here is _Allow Wildcat to Manage Difficulty_

A note, if you find the game too easy or hard, you have to change the difficulty in the basic game settings, in Immersive Creatures, and finally in Deadly Dragons. Don't forget this. For ultimate stunlock immersion turn on full body stagger here in Wildcat. Makes getting surrounded by half a dozen greataxe wielding Gilded extra fun, and I say that from first hand experience!

## XPMSE

For some reason this mod likes to change the styles randomly. Make sure all the styles are at default.

Close the MCM Menu, save the game, wait 10 seconds, and load.

This is so you'll have a save from before you configured Defeat because you must _always_ configure Defeat _last_.

## Defeat

First, enable the mod, close the menu, and wait for the message.

Then open the mod and under Global hit _Import Settings_

Remember that you can hit the activate key people on downed (or dead) people to "defeat" them, you can sneak up behind somebody to "defeat" them with G, and you can be "defeated" yourself at any time with K. It's slow to respond at times, so if you want to see "defeat" instead of you know, play the game, do it as soon as you get surrounded. Remember -- no creatures as of now. Finally this mod is buggy at its best. If something goes wrong the LL forums might tell you to clean and reconfigure from the MCM. I don't advise that because it resets a great many Skyrim variables. If you get in some kind of freakish infinite loop or other weird scenario, first try opening the console with ` and typing "epc." If that doesn't work, reload the game, preferably after you exit it.

# That's it! Go have fun in Sexy Skyrim!
