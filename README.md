## Introduction

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

Hello, my name is Cacophony and I got into modding as a teenager purely for the purposes of applying nudity. For a long time that was my only goal... until the modding communities surrounding Skyrim evolved. From there I branched out, building the TUCOGUIDE, Lexy, morphing Lexy into LOTD Plus, and finally discovering Wabbajack and spending almost all of my time either starting a new list or changing one I or someone else had made. With the discovery of Lover's Lab, I found out through much pain and torture that usually porn doesn't work well with playing Skyrim and playing Skyrim doesn't mesh well with playing porn and I lacked the skill to change that. So I solved it by simply paring back my ambitions.

If you want the gist of what this horribly cribbed modlist is, it grew out of the two most common questions I heard in the Lexy Discord's NSFW channel: how do I add SexLab to this? And: how do I switch the body to CBBE? I quickly came to realize that you don't do either of these things... unless you want a broken list that would have been more easily built from the ground up. So I did just that, keeping the parts of Lexy that I liked (which was the vast majority of it), throwing in a few other things to the mix, and adding some options to sex things up for both male and female characters. Hopefully this will take the heat off other modlist authors Discord channels and maybe even tide us over until erri120 gets around to finishing Lotus and we can descend into the pure depravity we all crave. Without further ado I present to you the Light Sexy Modlist: Please Stop Bothering Other Modlist Authors Edition.

## Requirements

It's recommended that you sign up for a Premium account on Nexus for five bucks a month (http://nexusmods.com)

Otherwise you'll have to download every file manually and put it in the right folder.

Also you'll need a Lover's Lab account (http://loverslab.com)

### System Specs

A note here. I use a 1080p monitor and I suspect the vast majority looking to play Skyrim in this day and age do too. So this modlist is geared toward two things: low VRAM usage and quick load times. You shouldn't need more than a midrange CPU and GPU from the last 5 years along with 8 GB VRAM and maybe 16 GB RAM (might could get away with 8). Strongly recommended is a solid state drive with at least 100 GB for the game itself and 50GB for the downloads (unless you never plan to update). This is not because load times are terrible on an HDD. Hashing with WJ for updates is a pain though.

### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time.

##### Change some Steam stuff

Right-click on Skyrim SE in your Steam library, choose Properties, uncheck _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_. While you're there, click the Updates tab and change it to _Only update this game when I launch it_. We will basically never launch Skyrim normally, it will always be via the script extender, so your game will never update. Finally, Wabbajack only supports the English version of Skyrim. If it's set to something else, go to the Language tab and switch it to English.

##### Clean Skyrim

If you have done _any_ modding of your Skyrim before, I recommend uninstalling it, deleting the Skyrim SE folder in Documents, then reinstalling it and taking the following steps:

1) Launch it from Steam
2) If it doesn't detect as Ultra, select Ultra
3) Set the _Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your preferred choices
4) Turn off _Antialiasing_
5) Uncheck _Windowed_ and _Borderless_

Then start the game and exit when you see the main menu (New Game, etc)

### Using Wabbajack

First get the latest version of LSM from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19cui-oVdXXTHIhcl8n6wfeq9D0CJQMKR.

Download it to wherever you keep your downloads.

Then install Wabbajack.

##### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1) Open Wabbajack
2) Load the Modlist from Disk
3) Adjust the download and installation paths
4) Click the Go/Begin button
5) Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##### Problems with Wabbajack

If you have a problem, exit Wabbajack, give it the old off and then on again, and try running it again. Only then should you ask for help.

**Could not download x**:

If a file could not download or is not whitelisted, the modlist needs to be updated. You're going to have to wait on me. :(

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

You paid for Skyrim didn't you? If not, go buy it off Steam and try again.

#### Copy Game Folder Files

Download the latest ENB Series from http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm and copy `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` to your Skyrim Special Edition folder inside your steamapps/common folder.

Copy all of the files from _game folder files_ over there.

## A note on BodySlide

My taste in BodySlides is as fickle as the wind... not only do I alternate between the naturalistic "Dream Girl" and something on the far end of - t h i c c - I also constantly change body types between UNP and CBBE depending on my mood or what armor mod I'd like to look at. For now everything is built with a custom "3BBB Cacophony thicc" body but it is entirely customizable. If you want to change this, pop into the NSFW channel and ask me.

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## A Few More Specific Notes

I'm not going to get deep into the weeds on all the mods included because quite frankly there's not anywhere near the amount of detail in this list as a lot of them and I don't think most of the people seeking to try this have a desire to read much about it. But here I will note a few things. My primary goal in creating this list was to play a super expanded LOTD with almost all of the huge worldspace mods like Falskaar, Wyrmstooth, Vigilant, etc included. I also wanted plenty of weapons and items to find organically without adding a bunch of collectibles that don't appeal to me. Does anybody ever find every collectible without looking them up? Doesn't that kinda defeat the purpose? Anyway, I speculate here. Most of the visuals, character development and gameplay mechanics are either cribbed from Lexy or strongly resemble Lexy with the exception of TUDM The Ultimate Dodge Mod. I guess that's all I have to say about that.

I did NOT include creature support because I wanted to use the Nemesis Behavior Engine without having to shoehorn FNIS in there too. I also did not include Devious Devices or any of its soft dependencies like Cursed Loot because only someone with more modding experience than me would know how to get those to stay stable in the long term. Hell I've run a list with nothing but ZaZ, DD, and Cursed Loot on Oldrim (their native soil) and have my save crap itself with guards attacking me in an infinite bondage prison loop within 12 hours of starting a new game so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Be A Casanova, Not A Maquis De Sade

The primary and most visible SexLab mods you'll be able to see are Amorous Adventures and Amorous Adventures Extended. These add hilarious meme-worthy sexy quests to a lot of the biggest female NPCs in Skyrim (including poor Elisif) and not only that, original voice assets are mixed and matched to give complete voiceover support to the custom dialogs. The next biggest one is SLEN - SexLab Eager NPCs which allows for a customizable seduction system. To round out the mix is SexLab Solutions which adds a bunch of ways to complete quests by either sexing them up yourself or offering one of your followers in case you're not into the target in question.

### Defeat

Yes, Defeat is in here. Yes, I have a setup for it ready to go. No, you won't see it a lot unless you change it yourself. The long and short of it is, if you want to see yourself getting taken advantage of every time you lose, under "Player as Victim" set yourself to "Essential." If you don't want to be taken advantage of at all and prefer a quick, merciful death, disable the victim section completely. This will still allow you to sublimate your fantasies harmlessly into Skyrim by tying people up and putting them in bags for later.

### Camera

I included the vastly inferior IFPV because I've got it defaulting to off so it doesn't muck with gameplay. You have to hit Numpad 0, then F a couple times to switch it on. It doesn't work at all when the partners are really close together (too much clipping) but it at least gives you a quick default to setting up your own POV view with Numpad 3. Relax and enjoy on it. Honestly I use this more to take a quick look down at my own huge bouncy boobs. :3

### General Skyrim Gameplay

Most of the actual Gameplay of this modlist is cribbed, again, from Lexy so if you're at all familiar with that setup you'll be right at home here. One thing I did add was the Ultimate Dodge Mod for a script-free instantaneous dodge roll (or step, or both) so you can still get away quickly after you install all 7 of those Lover's Lab NPC scanning nightmarish cloak script frameworks you're just dying to add. Just kidding, I love you. One thing I left out was the tedium and yes, cloak scripting of Needs mods so if you want to freeze, starve, and dehydrate you'll have to do it on your own list. I did add CACO and CCOR for the fun of building lotsa stuff that's overpowered. I'm helping!

### Bodies and NPCs

For the bodies I used CBBE 3BBB with the custom 3BBB Cacophony preset. This can be rebuilt to your liking using BodySlide if you want to drop by the NSFW channel. Note that leaving SMP on is NOT recommended because that physics mod was never completed and has a memory leak, to the best of my knowledge. The longer you leave it on the more likely it will crash, especially in combat, and then you have to restart Skyrim unless you like looking at non-Euclidean objects. Anyway you can switch between 3BBB and the friendlier but less flashy CBPC by pressing Numpad +. For the NPCs just trust that they're pretty, I'm lazy, and I haven't seen any BFBs (brown face bugs) yet. Everyone wearing vanilla clothes or armor has been outfitted with "super sloot" courtesy of Bad Dog so that makes this list decidedly unwelcome among mixed company. Play it alone! If you want to hide your shame, or simply muh immersion at the idea of Mjoll walking around with all four cheeks on display, stop by NSFW and I'll tell you how to get everyone to cover up their meat. The armor from the worldspace mods like Falskaar has been left unchanged.

### Final Notes

LODs HAVE NOT BEEN RUN. I don't want to do it until a little testing is done. I had 17 hours on this modlists previous version before a bunch of stuff updated and that had LODs, but c'est la vie. I'll get to it eventually.

This modlist is ugly. I used The Method on the whole thing for maximum compatibility but didnt merge anything because it caused more problems than it solved and wasn't strictly necessary since I'm nowhere near the plugin limit. So there are like 100 ESLs and far more modgroups. Don't run LOOT or open xEdit (SSEEdit in MO2) unless you know what you're doing. If you want to add something either have me write a patch for it or ask me how because my mind is not as other minds. Gear should be fine, just make sure it has 3BBB compatible BodySlides and tack it on at the bottom of both the left and right panes of MO2. You can use the AddItemMenu object that starts in your inventory to search for any item or browse for anything in the list. If you find this to be too big a temptation just drop it in the starting cell before you talk to the statue to begin your game.

## Game MCM Options

None of this is written in stone, these are just the settings I use. Play freely with great abandon on all the sexy stuff. Consider carefully any gameplay changes because with just a couple of them you can make things either really hard or really easy. I myself don't have the balance perfect, bandits and dragons crush me but I generally walk through everything else.

**Wait until no new messages appear in the top left corner!**

If you get no more messages, save the game and open the MCM.

## SexLab

Hit the install/update SexLab thingie on the right.

Close the MCM menu and wait for all the messages to stop.

Reopen the menu and:

Under _Sex Diary_ set your sexuality to your preference.

Under _Rebuild and Clean_ choose _Import Settings_

Close the MCM menu, save the game, wait 10 seconds, then reload.

## A Matter of Time

Easy peasy. Just head to the _Presets_ menu and choose _Load User Settings_

## Clockwork

Unless you want to go mad, change the _Gilded Recovery Time_ to _24 Hours_

## Complete Alchemy

I don't recommend changing a single thing here. If you're salty about the lack of needs mods, you can go to _Basic Needs_ and enable _Hunger_ and _Fatigue_. If you do this, set Notifications to _3rd Person_

## Complete Crafting

OK, this one's annoying.

Under _Recipe Display_, disable _Crafting Categories_ and _Item Type Filters_ because I haven't been able to get them right.

Under _Crafting Options_, I recommend enabling _Artifact Replicas_ so you can make some truly badass stuff and _Matching Set Circlets_ so your Bijins don't have to cover their fabulous hair with ugly helmets.

Under _Learning & XP_, set _Tanning Rack_ to 0.2 and _Smelter_ to 0.1.

Almost done. Under _Mining & Materials_, set the Mining Preset to _Faster Mining_ and _Firewood_ like so:

_Firewood Per Chop:_ 6

_Max Per Activation:_ 1

You'll be glad you did.

Finally, under _Miscellaneous_:

Set Leveled Items to _Auto Upgrade_. This way your unique gear will level with you!

## Deadly Dragons

Don't do anything here but turn off Knockdown unless you want dragons to make you ragequit.

## Diverse Dragons Col. 3

Supposedly some dragons have problems with godrays and invincibility but I'm gonna YOLO and say

_Control_, _Enable All Creatures_

Close the menu and wait for the message to say splicing is complete.

## Extended UI

Hit _Hide Legendary_, _Show Attribute Modifiers_, and _Show Skill Modifiers_

## FEC

You can do a lot of wacky stuff with this one, like make people explode or melt. But to keep you from spending all day in here I just say go to _Player Effects_ and enable _Soul Absorb_ for when those dragons inevitably kill you.

## Follower Framework

Like _Matter of Time_, this one let me do all the work beforehand. Just go to _System_ and under _Save/Load Config_ hit _Load From File_.

Exit the MCM and reopen.

## GIST Soul Trap

Don't make soul traps reliant on your Enchanting skill. That's annoying. Just enable messages when you trap a soul and leave everything else alone.

## Immersive Creatures

This mod barely works so you'll have to disable most of it. Here goes...

First go to _Creature Toggles_ and disable _Goblins_. They cause crashes.

Then go to _Additional Spawns_, _Night Spawns_, and _Random Spawns_ and set them all to _Deactivated_. They all cause crashes.

Why is this mod in here you ask? Well... this is the 90s. A man's gotta have a little variety.

## LOTD Settings

Under _General_ set _Shipment Crate Locations_ to all available... _Carriages, Inns and Player Houses_

## Maids II: Deception

Shoutout to erri. I wanted to see what this was about before Lotus 0.3's release in 2077 so it's still in here. I read the world encounters have issues so disable them under _Settings_.

## OBIS: Patrols

Just _Enable?_ and move on.

## Quick Light

The brighter the better. Set _Brightness_ to _Wide_ and the hotkey to your preference, I like to have things on the Numpad so I always set it to Numpad 1.

## Sacrosant Vampires

_Disable Fortitude_ or Defeat will screw up your game as a vampire. If you're like me and think feeding should make you stronger instead of weaker, turn on _Vampiric Drain: Reverse Progression_

## SexLab Aroused

Under Settings, hit _Purge Dead Actors_ and _Enable SOS_

If it were me in the interest of preventing Papyrus strain I would I would max the _Scan Interval_ out to _300_ but thats very unresponsive so just leave it where it is.

## SexLab Eager NPCs

I can't really tell you how you like your porn, man. Do what you want. I recommend hitting _Enable and Set Defaults_ for a base to work from. Everything else is kinda up to you, but I will tell you that the _Leveled List_ section adds a bunch of sexytime potions scattered around for roleplay purposes, and don't worry about what _SOS Integration_ reports because that detection is broken. Otherwise the mod works, trust me! One final note, if you want seduction to be really easy like you're the hottest being alive, you can do that with the charm difficulty. Even still you'll have to pay up at the beginning. But don't worry, your Speech will also go up with every success (the amount of which is also configurable) and it'll get easier.

## SexLab Tools

This can be used to set up a scene with whoever you want, however many people you want, in whatever combination, without conditions. Set the _Matchmaker Queue_ hotkey to something you'll remember. I use Numpad 2.

It's really janky though. Set the primary "bottom" as the receiver and add actors to the remaining slots until your horny self is satisfied, then if you want yourself click on empty space and begin the scene. What stinks though is that you have to type in the total number of participants every blinkin' time you add somebody. I don't think any animations support more than 5 people at a time, you swinger.

## SL Anim Loader

Just hit _Enable All_, wait for the message, then hit _Register Anims_ and wait for the message. Takes a bit.

## SLA Monitor Widget

Configure this how you like, but I recommend setting the _Interval_ to _120 or higher_ since that's when Aroused updates and the _Scanning Range_ to _512_ to keep it from scanning everything that Aroused is already scanning. You might further limit it to dudes if you only have interest in them or the ladies if you're oriented that way. But if you're open-minded or nosy then scan away!

## Storm Lighting

You can get crazy with the aggressive storms but to save time I recommend just going to _Advanced_ and hitting _Compatibility Mode_. It's required for Cathedral Weathers.

## The Ultimate Dodge Mod

Ah, my favorite part of this mod list. Instant 8 way dodges. An **Important Note** here is that Step Dodge will _not work_ with the dodge roll animation I have installed. If you try it you will do a funky planking float in midair which is pretty funny to see but probably not why you play. Set it to  _Roll Only_ to avoid this. If you want the option to switch between roll and step like the dodge mod was designed, untick _Dodge Roll Reanimated_ in the modlist and rerun Nemesis. It's kinda tricky to use, Sneak has been moved to the Shift key and you roll dodge with Control. Good luck.

## Trade & Barter

Enable _Modify Barter Settings_ and set the preset to _Medium_

This keeps you from accumulating hundreds of thousands of gold unless you become a master wordsmith so if you don't like that turn it off.

## Ultimate Combat

Under _Game Balance_, disable _Speed Bonus_.

Under _Others_, disable _Swing Effect_. This has been known to bug out with Nemesis and render you incapable of weapon animations.

Under _NPC Setting_, set _Dodge_ to _Disable_. This is handled by TUDM.

## Wildcat

Only thing you have to change here is _Allow Wildcat to Manage Difficulty_

A note, if you find the game too easy or hard, you have to change the difficulty in the basic game settings, in Immersive Creatures, and finally in Deadly Dragons. Don't forget this. For ultimate stunlock immersion turn on full body stagger here in Wildcat. Makes getting surrounded by half a dozen greataxe wielding Gilded extra fun, and I say that from first hand experience!

## XPMSE

For some reason this mod likes to change the styles randomly. Make sure all the styles are at default.

Close the MCM Menu, save the game, wait 10 seconds, and load.

This is so you'll have a save from before you configured Defeat because you must _always_ configure Defeat _last_.

## Defeat

First, enable the mod, close the menu, and wait for the message.

Then open the mod and under Global hit _Import Settings_

Remember that you can hit the G people on downed (or dead) people to "defeat" them, you can sneak up behind somebody to "defeat" them with G, and you can be "defeated" yourself at any time with K. It's slow to respond at times, so if you want to see "defeat" instead of you know, play the game, do it as soon as you get surrounded. Remember -- no creatures as of now. Finally this mod is buggy at its best. If something goes wrong the LL forums might tell you to clean and reconfigure from the MCM. I don't advise that because it resets a great many Skyrim variables. If you get in some kind of freakish infinite loop or other weird scenario, reload the game, preferably after you exit it.

# That's it! Go have fun in Sexy Skyrim!
