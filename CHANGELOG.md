## Changelog

### 0.1.5.1

Compiled the thing for Engine Fixes and also corrected the readme link, which was misspelled. 9_9

### 0.1.5.0

Updates for DynDoLOD Resources and Majestic Mountains got me this time. There were also updates to Tsuki's Book of 3BBB and Eeekie's NPCs that I forgot about. Please be sure to comment on Tsuki's armors, Tsuki is a regular with us. I don't _think_ any of this will affect saves from 0.1.4.0+, it's just that any LODs you have run will have the old textures.

### 0.1.4.2

Switched back to Silent Horizons since I like the colors. Also made sure not to forget the files for the Skyrim folder.

### 0.1.4.1

Finally got the 3BA version of Bad Dog's in here, complete with zaps for all the naughty bits. Switched to Serio - Cathedral ENB so the Cathedral Weathers MCM actually does something now. The CLARALUX Testing Facility also has a more dramatic effect if you want to stop by there to customize the lighting.

### 0.1.4.0

An animation pack was taken down so I had to remove that. Also rearranged some of my ESPs and merges. New game required. Don't update if you don't want to start over. Please note: I mistakenly included my MO2 INI so you may get some invalid directory errors. If that happens delete ModOrganizer.ini in the main directory and try again. Be sure to put it in Portable mode for Skyrim SE and skip the tutorials.

### 0.1.3.6

Tsuki's Book of CBBE 3BBB updated, so I included the changes. Please report any clipping, physics or other bugs with these armors on that modpage.

### 0.1.3.5

Billyy's Animation Pack updated, so the changes have been implemented in this version.

### 0.1.3.3

Removed both IFPV and Alternate Camera because I don't like playing with them. The BodySlides are now in the right place for those of you who want to just jump in and play with a "full bounce kit"

### 0.1.3.2

Ran the Book of CBBE to the wrong output folder, so it wasn't updated with my preset. Corrected.

### 0.1.3.1

Eeekie's released a new version just as I released 0.1.3, so I updated that. Forgot to mention I have removed Maids II due to navmesh conflicts and crashes with LODs. Lotus should have it though!

### 0.1.3

My ambitious attempt to further customize my NPC overhauls resulted in crashing facegens around the city of Whiterun. I went back to my old simplistic method that works and resolved conflicts with some NordRace and HighElf entries in eeekie's that could have caused problems. Several ESPs were changed and moved around with this revision so I highly doubt it will be stable with old saves. Don't update if you're in the middle of a playthrough, and if you're getting crashes stop by the Discord server and I'll attempt to come up with a stopgap solution.

### 0.1.2

Most significant update is that I abandoned The Method. It was hurting my brain. Added Alternate Conversation Camera to give the player a chance to admire himself (or herself) (or theirself). Installed a Book of CBBE 3BBB Conversion file to offer more variety in armors. Customized the default BodySlide preset along with all armors. Added a pared-down Skyrim_Strapons with only the Soulgem and Dwemer options. (This is mostly because Amorous Adventures usually refuses to play lesbian animations and the default Skyrim strapon is horrifically bad.) Updated relevant portions of the README.md

### 0.1.1

Switched the BodySlide output to _Imitation Dream Girl_ in the hopes that it would produce less clipping. Altered some stored MCM menu options to better reflect playability. Updated relevant potions of the README.md

### 0.1

Initial release.
