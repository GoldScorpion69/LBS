## Changelog

### 0.1.3.3

Removed both IFPV and Alternate Camera because I don't like playing with them. The BodySlides are now in the right place for those of you who want to just jump in and play with a "full bounce kit"

### 0.1.3.2

Ran the Book of CBBE to the wrong output folder, so it wasn't updated with my preset. Corrected.

### 0.1.3.1

Eeekie's released a new version just as I released 0.1.3, so I updated that. Forgot to mention I have removed Maids II due to navmesh conflicts and crashes with LODs. Lotus should have it though!

### 0.1.3

My ambitious attempt to further customize my NPC overhauls resulted in crashing facegens around the city of Whiterun. I went back to my old simplistic method that works and resolved conflicts with some NordRace and HighElf entries in eeekie's that could have caused problems. Several ESPs were changed and moved around with this revision so I highly doubt it will be stable with old saves. Don't update if you're in the middle of a playthrough, and if you're getting crashes stop by the Discord server and I'll attempt to come up with a stopgap solution.

### 0.1.2

Most significant update is that I abandoned The Method. It was hurting my brain. Added Alternate Conversation Camera to give the player a chance to admire himself (or herself) (or theirself). Installed a Book of CBBE 3BBB Conversion file to offer more variety in armors. Customized the default BodySlide preset along with all armors. Added a pared-down Skyrim_Strapons with only the Soulgem and Dwemer options. (This is mostly because Amorous Adventures usually refuses to play lesbian animations and the default Skyrim strapon is horrifically bad.) Updated relevant portions of the README.md

### 0.1.1

Switched the BodySlide output to _Imitation Dream Girl_ in the hopes that it would produce less clipping. Altered some stored MCM menu options to better reflect playability. Updated relevant potions of the README.md

### 0.1

Initial release.
